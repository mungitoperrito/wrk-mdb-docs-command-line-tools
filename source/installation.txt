Installation
------------

The {+dbtools+} can be :ref:`installed with the MongoDB Server
<installed-with-server>` on Linux platforms, or as a
:ref:`standalone installation <standalone-installation>` on all
platforms.

.. _installed-with-server:

Install with Server - Linux Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the {+dbtools+} as part of a MongoDB Server installation on
Linux, you must use your Linux distribution's package manager to install
the Server:

- Follow the instructions for your platform according to the MongoDB
  Edition you wish to install:
  
  - :manual:`Install MongoDB Server Community Edition </administration/install-on-linux>`.

  - :manual:`Install MongoDB Server Enterprise Edition </administration/install-enterprise-linux>`.

- After completing the installation, the {+dbtools-short+} are available
  in the same location as the Server.

If you wish to install the {+dbtools-short+} via your Linux package
manager without installing the Server, see
:ref:`standalone-installation-package-manager`.

.. _standalone-installation:

Install as Standalone - All Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install the {+dbtools+} as a standalone installation, for all
supported platforms:

- Follow the download link for your MongoDB Edition:

  - `MongoDB Community Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community?tck=docs_databasetools>`_

  - `MongoDB Enterprise Download Center <https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/enterprise?tck=docs_databasetools>`_

- Select your :guilabel:`OS` (operating system) from the dropdown menu,
  then select the appropriate :guilabel:`Package` for your platform
  according to the following chart:

  .. list-table::

    * - OS 
   
      - Package

    * - *Linux* 

      - ``TGZ`` package

    * - *Windows*

      - ``ZIP`` package

    * - *macOS*

      - ``TGZ`` package 

- Once downloaded, unpack the archive and copy the tools to a location
  on your hard drive.

  .. tip::

     Linux and macOS users may wish to copy the tools to a filesystem
     location that is defined in the ``$PATH`` environment variable,
     such as ``/usr/bin``. Doing so allows referencing each tool
     directly on the command line by name, without needing to specify
     its full path, or first navigating to its parent directory. See the
     :ref:`installation guide <tutorial-installation>` for your platform
     for more information.

.. _standalone-installation-package-manager:

Install as Standalone - Linux Package Manager
`````````````````````````````````````````````

Linux users may alternatively choose to install the {+dbtools-short+}
using their system's package manager (e.g. ``yum`` or ``apt``)
separately from the Server. To do so, follow the 
:ref:`installation guide <tutorial-installation>` for your platform,
specifying ``mongodb-database-tools`` instead of ``mongodb-org`` or
``mongodb-enterprise`` during the installation step.
